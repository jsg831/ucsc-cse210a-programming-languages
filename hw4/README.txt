# HW4 - WHILE-SS

## Requirements
- /bin/env: To launch Python3 intepreter on the machine (See first line of
  while-ss).
- Python3 (3.10.1): The intepreter is written in Python3. Lower versions of
  Python3 may work, but I have not tried that.
- SLY (0.4): This is a Python Lex/Yacc-like library that generates the tokenizer and
  the parser for this intepreter.

## How to Run
1. Run `make` to install SLY. (If this does not work, please install `sly` with
`pip` tool.
2. Run `./while-ss` or `./test.sh` after merging with the test code
